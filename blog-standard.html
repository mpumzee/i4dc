                                    As I walk through my village in Matobo, the conversations are loud as elders share
                                    how ‘things have changed’ especially the rainfall amount and patterns. To the
                                    Christians, these are the signs of the ‘end times’ as spelt out by the scriptures;
                                    To the traditionalists Mother Nature is angry at us because we have forgotten who we
                                    as we abandoned the rainmaking ceremonies at the Njelele Shrine and nolonger conduct
                                    Intelele (a ceremony in Matobo where men and youth embark on environment clean-up
                                    just before the rains start) and; To the scientists Climate Change is upon us! Even
                                    the former American President Donald Trump who was a denialist and used to call it a
                                    ‘hoax’ slowly made a U-turn towards the end of his tenure. This global phenomenon
                                    whose impact and effects have become more visible and rampant forces us to ask
                                    critical question - How do we respond to it in our own way informed by our own lived
                                    experiences, our culture and our needs as a people?
                                </p>

                                    In Matobo and most probably other rural areas Agritex officers, NGOs, researchers,
                                    the academia etc. have been preaching the gospel of drought resistant crops,
                                    conservation farming and many other methods all centred on Climate Smart Agriculture
                                    (CSA). However, communities continue to produce maize through subsistence-oriented
                                    farming where 80% of crop production is rain-fed despite an increase in frequency of
                                    dry spells during the rainy season. They are part of the small scale farmers who
                                    contribute more than 70% of the country’s staple crops such as maize, wheat and
                                    small grains. Yearly yields have been decreasing and poverty and food insecurity
                                    escalating save for the last faming season where rains were abnormally good.

                                    Studies show that Zimbabwe has been increasingly experiencing droughts and other
                                    natural hazards like floods, strong winds, hailstorms and heat-waves. In the period
                                    between 1991 and 2016 a total of six moderate to severe drought of which four of
                                    these were linked to El Nino events have hit Zimbabwe. Projections indicate that by
                                    2070 average temperatures in Zimbabwe would have increased by 2.5percent while
                                    rainfall would decrease by 5.9percent. These are worrying statistics especially for
                                    regions iv and v that are generally dry. Food insecurity is expected to increase due
                                    to droughts, declines in runoff, higher temperatures and increased evaporation. For
                                    decades, rural development agencies have been spreading the gospel of small grains
                                    in rural communities which somehow has been lowly adopted. Whilst reasons behind
                                    this are well documented, localised solutions that are context specific and address
                                    the question of Climate Change in rural communities in Zimbabwe remain scarce.

                                    Over the years there has been a huge investment in Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA)
                                    to address poverty and food security. Globally a lot has been written about Climate
                                    Smart Agriculture and how various countries are adopting its various facets that are
                                    relevant or feasible in their context. Just to highlight, CSA has three major goals
                                    are focused on i) sustainable increase in agricultural productivity; ii) climate
                                    change adaptation and resilience and; iii) reduction of greenhouse emissions. In
                                    Zimbabwe, most efforts by international development agencies are on building
                                    resilience in communities.

                                    The target has been largely small holder communal farmers in the drier
                                    agro-ecological regions iv and v. Some of the notable programmes include the
                                    Protracted Relief Programme (PRP) that targeted almost 130,000 farmers and was
                                    funded by European Union and DFID and also the Coping with Drought and Climate
                                    Change (CwDCC) in Zimbabwe and Building Climate Resilient Rural Communities in
                                    Zimbabwe both supported by UNDP. Some organisations such as Pro Africa have been
                                    consistent in their drive towards addressing poverty and food security in rural
                                    Matabeleland through their gravity fed irrigation systems. What is worrying is that
                                    despite such investments in terms of capital, material resources and technical
                                    skills food insecurity and poverty has remained a perennial problem in as far as
                                    evidence from yearly ZimVac reports is concerned.

                                    The effects of Climate Change are projected to reduce by 8% the yield in Southern
                                    Africa and South Asia by 2050. This is expected to have major impact on maize,
                                    wheat, sorghum, and millet than rice, cassava, and sugar cane which is quite
                                    disturbing for Zimbabwe and Southern Africa in general. The World Bank has been
                                    emphasising the importance of reviving and investing in the agricultural sector
                                    especially for Sub-Saharan Africa. A lot of proposals have been brought forward by
                                    Climate Smart Agriculture advocates in terms of how farmers or communities can adapt
                                    to climate change. There are suggestions that farmers and communities in general
                                    should adopt crop diversification, change planting days in response to precipitation
                                    patterns, plant tree crops, practice mixed cropping, and generate income from
                                    alternative sources.

                                    The Africa Climate-Smart Agriculture (ACSA) set a target that by 2025 around
                                    25million farmers should be practising CSA. Africa and Asia are involved in
                                    collaborative research initiatives through CARIAA that uses the hotspot approach and
                                    targets the glacier-fed river basins and the semi-arid areas of Africa and Asia.
                                    Studies show that a number of countries in Africa are investing in CSA as they
                                    respond to the impact of Climate Change. Local farmers in Niger whose two-thirds of
                                    the surface is covered by desert have greened about 5m ha of land as a way of
                                    protecting and managing the natural regeneration of their vegetation. In Kenya,
                                    communities in Nyando area experience serious soil erosion that has led to gullies
                                    over the years leaving 81% of the families in the villages experiencing hunger for a
                                    period between 1-2 months when they cannot produce from their farm lands. Responding
                                    to these challenges farmers in Nyando adopted water conservation techniques and
                                    improved livestock management through investing in resilient livestock varieties.
                                    Malawi has been investing in conservation farming whilst Tanzania’s focus has been
                                    in irrigation based farming as it promotes its agriculture sector which accounts for
                                    about 46% of its GDP.

                                    Whilst Climate Change is a global problem, it is imperative that solutions are
                                    context specific. Instead of importing ideas forcing them (consciously or
                                    unconsciously) to our communities, there is a need to rethink the approach to
                                    Climate Change through investing more in context specific and localised solutions.
                                    The uniqueness of every environment calls for new ways of thinking that are home
                                    grown, inclusive and specific to the localities. That the one-size fit all approach,
                                    or importation and imposition of knowledge does not work is well documented. For
                                    decades, the people of Matobo have had their own direct and lived experiences and
                                    knowledge in as far as these climate related changes are concerned and the question
                                    is how much of this knowledge is documented and let alone feeding into development
                                    programmes implemented in the area? Whilst baseline surveys and situation analysis
                                    have been some of the approaches adopted by development agencies to gather the views
                                    and knowledge of these communities, long term investment in research (e.g
                                    longitudinal studies or ethnography) for deeper understanding of the complexities
                                    characterising communities and their understanding and responses to Climate Change.

                                    Knowledge production centres like Matopo Research Station or academic institutions
                                    like Nust and LSU for example should be the driving force behind finding localised
                                    solutions to Climate Change related problems. This is not to say these institutions
                                    are not involved in knowledge production but rather to provoke critical thoughts
                                    regarding the state of these institutions, their levels of investment in knowledge
                                    production as well as the value and utilisation of knowledge they produce. It is
                                    high time we learn from the COVID-19 pandemic on how indigenous knowledges,
                                    technology and science are forming a united front against the pandemic.

                                    In Bulawayo, Zimbabwe’s second largest city, community gardens are a notable feature across the city’s suburbs as urban agriculture has expanded over the years. However, 
                                    the majority of the country’s populace plunged into abject poverty as a result of the country’s long deceased economy whilst unemployment opportunities have continued to soar over the years.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For a city that has previously been famed as the industrial hub of the once regarded ‘bread basket’ of Africa, the effects have been deep as many are stranded on ways to put food on the table. As for Gogo Emily Kambobe, a 93 year of widow from Luveve, her community garden has been the answer as she still holds on to strips of land she acquired from the city council about three decades ago.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Originally from Nkayi, in Matabeleland North, Gogo Emily relocated to Bulawayo in 1947 where she got married and had 2 children with her elder child born in 1948. Sharing her story on how she came to be a member of the welfare gardens, Gogo Emily says these gardens were handed to the less privileged members of the community ideally to help them fend for their families. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    “Back then, these gardens were purely for feeding one’s family and we didn’t care much about sharing our produce with others but now things have changed,” said Gogo Emily adding that the gardens are now a source of income as the situation is tough.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Even at an old age, the old lady has refused to take a bow from the gardens. The community has even become accustomed to seeing her dragging her garden hose either heading home or to the gardens. The gardens have remained Gogo Emily’s occupation helping her raise her family and grandchildren through them. They are all she has ever known since having been forced to leave her long time job due to some sickness. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    “Through these gardens I have bred children who now have children of their own,” she said.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Urban agriculture has as time gone by, been faced with its fair share of problems which have directly hindered the potential and productivity of these gardens. The city’s chronic water troubles compounded with acts of vandalism by thieves has meant plenty times the farmer’s efforts quite often goes to waste.  Heavily dependent on the city council’s reclaimed water the gardens have not been spared by the water crisis facing the city. The supply of the reclaimed water which is directly channeled to the gardens has been dwindling over the years.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    “We rely on the reclaimed water which council pumps to our garden tapes but now the supply has dropped since the council is failing to provide water to residents,” Gogo Emily said.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    While injecting funding into these community schemes may appear as a much easier and quicker fix, a few hundred meters away from the welfare gardens lies donor funded gardens that prove otherwise. Strikingly similar conceptually in many ways but differing in resourcing and structuring, the community garden initiative has seen a bulk of its members hang their hoes early as a result of many factors. These range from its endless politics to factors that are not of their own making.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The increase in humanitarian efforts towards poverty alleviation over the years has seen various community gardens in the city finding support from well-wishers. According to one of the community gardens member, Thembelani Ndlovu donor support managed to address key areas such as drawing water from the borehole and fencing the area. Sadly, vandalism and theft have seen some of these efforts go down the drain leaving donors and the communities frustrated.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    “The donor erected a fence for us, provided a submissive pump and a big generator along with it but after a year it was stolen due to lack of security,” said Thembelani highlighting that lack of coordination and squabbles within the members of the community gardens led to the donor stopping further funding the scheme.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    “When we first started this, part of the idea was to put some money aside from whatever we sell so that we can at least have something in hand as savings from our work so that in the event we want something and we failing to buy it, the donor can help with confidence we have something from what they had taught and given us previously,” said Thembelani.  
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    What remain the most pertinent questions perhaps to the garden members is how other similar schemes elsewhere in other suburbs have managed to flourish beyond what anyone could imagine.
